# CS-350


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
**The project was creating a thermostat embedded system.  It would read the current temperature and adjust accordingly.  I could also press the buttons on the side to increase or decrease the temperature.  An LED light would light up if the thermostat was being raised to the correct temperature.  All of this also utilized a timer loop to provide callbacks.**

What did you do particularly well?
**All of it was done particularly well.  However, the part I did the best on was creating a program that could read my button presses accurately.**

Where could you improve?
**I can improve on creating a proper state machine switch statement.  I did not have one in my project when I could have.  In my previous assignment I tried to create one and I struggled with it.**

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
**I am adding the C programming language.  How to use Code Composer Studio.  And how to work and program an embedded device.**

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
**Time management and extensive planning was needed a lot for this project.  In the future I will create state diagrams and pseudocode for different projects or course work that I work on.  Also, learning how to program in C with this assignment will help in the future.  This is the only class that I used C programming.  This broadened my coding experience and will help in the future.**

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
**I ensured there was proper commenting throughout my program.  I also had functions for everything and named everthing properly.  This ensures that if someone else picked up my project they could edit it as needed.**
